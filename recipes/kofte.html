            Homemade Turkish Meatballs known as kofte are the best things to happen on your dinner table. These are spicy, tender and perfectly juicy. It’s not a secret any more to make meatballs at home that are much tastier than store-bought ones.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef, 80% lean</li>
            <li>½ cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 onions, finely chopped or pureed</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, mashed (optional)</li>
            <li>1 and ½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes or Aleppo pepper, optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, optional</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, finely diced onion and mashed garlic.</li>
            <li>Add in the spices.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix baking soda, water and lemon juice. Pour this into the ground beef mixture. Mix well with your hand. Knead it for about a minute so that everything is combined well.</li>
            <li>Cover and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or at least 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Roll them into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a cast iron pan or any non-stick pan. Cook the meatballs over high heat, flipping them over or shaking the pan occasionally so that all sides are cooked for about 3 minutes. Don't overcrowd the pan, cook the meatballs in batches until they finish or save some to freeze.</li>
        </ol>
